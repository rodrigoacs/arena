## üèÅ Running the Project Locally

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (v20+ recommended)
* npm

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/arena.git
    cd arena
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Development (Hot Reload)

To start the development server (usually at `http://localhost:5173`):
```sh
npm run dev
```

### Production Build

To compile and minify for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Static files will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

## üê≥ Deploy with Docker

The project includes a multi-stage `Dockerfile` for an optimized build and a `docker-compose.yml` to simplify deployment.

### 1. Build the Image

To build the Docker image for the frontend:

```sh
docker build -t arena-frontend .
```

### 2. Using Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` is configured to use an external network called `proxy` (common in setups with Traefik or Nginx Proxy Manager).

If you use a `proxy` network:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

If you just want to run locally (e.g., on port 8080):

1.  Create a `docker-compose.override.yml` file at the project root:
    ```yml
    version: '3.8'

    services:
      app:
        networks:
          - default # Remove the external 'proxy' network
        ports:
          - "8080:80" # Map the container's port 80 to host port 8080

    networks:
      proxy:
        driver: none # Disable the external network
      default:
        driver: bridge
    ```
2.  Start the container:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
3.  The app will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.
